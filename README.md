# system-design-for-interviews-and-beyond
With more than 15 years of industry experience, I have dedicated the last 9 years to developing scalable, highly available, and low-latency distributed systems. Throughout my journey, I have pondered the best approach to mastering system design. While there are numerous resources available for learning individual concepts, few offer a comprehensive understanding of system design methodology. Even after investing significant time and acquiring substantial knowledge, mastering true system design thinking remains challenging. This type of thinking is essential for addressing questions such as where to begin the design process, what steps to take next, how to dissect complex problems into manageable sub-problems, and how to make educated guesses when faced with unknowns. Motivated by this challenge, I set out to create a course aimed at cultivating and enhancing system design thinking. Two years later, the results of this endeavor speak for themselves.
